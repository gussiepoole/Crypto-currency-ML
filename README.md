# Crypto-currency-ML

## Project Overview
A project using unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes

• The data was first scaled

•	Predicting the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies of both unscaled and scaled data demonstrated the importance of preprocessing and scaling data      before fitting it to the model

•	I optimized the clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to to reduce the features to three principal component.

•	In this project 90% of the total variance is condensed into the 3 PCA variables
