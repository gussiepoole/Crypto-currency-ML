# Crypto-currency-ML
A project using unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes

•	In this project I used the elbow method algorithm to find the best value for k using the original data and then the scaled data

•	Predicting the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies of both unscaled and scaled data demonstrated the importance of preprocessing and scaling data      before fitting it to the model

•	I optimized the clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to to reduce the features to three principal component

•	In this project 90% of the total variance is condensed into the 3 PCA variables
